### Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
A Fast Fourier transform algorithm allows us to decompose a signal (in this case the sound) from the time domain to the frequency domain. It basically means that if we measure the sound over a period of time we can calculate the frequencies that created it. <br>

The most important parameters of FFT that you need to understand are:<br>
* The sample rate or sampling frequency (fs)
> It is measured in Hz and it is basically the number of measurements per second e.g 48kHz. For an audio signal, this is usually the upper limit of your microphone as defined in the datasheet. The higher the sampling frequency, the higher the frequencies we can detect.
* The number of samples or block length (BL)
> This is the number of measurements we use for our calculation and it is always as a power of two. e.g: 8,16,32,… 1024, 2048 . The higher the number, the more accurate frequencies we can detect. However, more samples mean more computation required, so it is up to you to set this number based on your computing power and accuracy needs.
* The measurement duration (D)
> This is calculated as the time required to take all the required samples. If our sample rate is 48kHz, this means the microphone can take 48000 measurements in one second. But if we only need 1024 measurements, the duration is D = BL/fs = 1024/48000 = 21.3 ms.
* The frequency resolution (df)
> This is the spacing between two frequency results and it is defined as df = fs/BL = 48000/1024 = 46.88 Hz . In practice this means that it will be impossible to distinguish between a frequency of 4670Hz and 4680Hz, because the difference is less than the resolution.
* Nyquist frequency (fn)
> Based on Niquist theory, this is the maximum frequency that can be accurately determined by FFT and it is calculated as fn = fs / 2 . So we need a sample rate of at least 48kHz to be able to detect a frequency of 24kHz (The range for human hearing is from 20Hz to 20kHz ).

Every FFT implementation takes as input an array of BL values ( BL = 1024 in our above example). It is up to us to make sure these values are sampled correctly (at a fixed sample rate)! The result is also an array of the same size as the input (1024 returned values). We call these values, **bins**. The value of each bin represents the amplitude of a frequency in the measurement. When our doorbell rings, the value of the 1kHz bin will be very high compared with the other bins.

Each bin has a range equal with the frequency resolution (df). So bin[0] will represent the frequencies from 0Hz to 46.88Hz, bin[2] represents 46.88Hz to 93.76Hz and so on. However, due to Niquist theory, only half of the bins contain good values (in our example covering from 0Hz to 24kHz – bin[512]). This is half of the sample rate.

As an example, if we want to get the amplitude for 1kHz for an audio signal sampled at 48kHz with 1024 samples, we will look at the bin 21 (1000Hz/df = 1000Hz/46.88Hz = 21.33). Bin 21 actually covers frequencies from 984.48Hz to 1031.36Hz, hence the decimal value for the bin.

### Audio spectrum analyser with Friture
[Friture](http://friture.org/) is a free real-time audio analyser for linux, mac and windows. You can use it to check the exact pattern and frequency of your trigger sound: the door bell or fire alarm.
