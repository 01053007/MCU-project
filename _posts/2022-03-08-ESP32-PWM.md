Introduction to PWM functions

## PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

### [PWM Signal Properties](https://deepbluembedded.com/esp32-pwm-tutorial-examples-analogwrite-arduino/)
A typical PWM signal has the following properties that we can control by programming the microcontroller’s PWM peripheral’s registers. Such as PWM Frequency, PWM Resolution, and PWM Duty Cycle.

### PWM architecture
![](https://github.com/rkuo2000/MCU-course/blob/main/images/PWM_functional_diagram.png?raw=true)
CMRx+1 >= CNR: PWM output high <br>
CMRx+1 <  CNR: PWM output low <br>

**PWM Frequency** = PWM_Clock/(prescale+1)*(clock divider)/(CNR+1) <br>

**Duty ratio** = (CMR+1)/(CNR+1)<br>

### ESP32 PWM Channels
The ESP32 PWM controller has 8 high-speed channels and 8 low-speed channels, which gives us a total of 16 channels.<br>
For each group, there are 4 timers / 8 channels. This means every two channels share the same timer. Therefore, we can’t independently control the PWM frequency of each couple of channels.

On NodeMCU-32S, GPIO34, GPIO35, GPIO36, GPIO39 don’t support PWM functionality, because they are input-only ADC pins.

### ESP32 ledc APIs
List of all the LEDC APIs exposed by the driver. These functions are written for Arduino IDE port of ESP32.
* `ledcSetup(channel, frequency, resolution_bits);`
* `ledcAttachPin(pin, channel);`
* `ledcWrite(channel, dutycycle);`
* `ledcRead(channel);`
* `ledcWriteTone(channel, frequency);`
* `ledcWriteNote(channel, note, octave);`
* `ledcReadFreq(channel);`
* `ledcDetachPin(pin);`

Some important points to remember while configuring PWM Channel in ESP32:
* As there are **16** PWM channels, the ‘channel’ argument takes any value between 0 and 15.<br>
* Next is the frequency of the PWM signal. You can set the frequency as per your requirements like 1 KHz, 5 KHz, 8 KHz, and 10 KHz.
* The resolution of the PWM is also configurable and ESP32 PWM can be programmed anywhere between 1 bit to 16 bit resolution.<br>
* PWM frequency and resolution are inversely proportional and is dependent on the clock source. So, be careful when selecting the values for frequency and resolution.<br>
* Finally, assign a GPIO pin for PWM Output. You can assign any GPIO Pin but be careful when assigning (do not use already used GPIO pins like UART, SPI, etc.).

The following table shows a few commonly used PWM frequencies and resolutions.

![](https://github.com/rkuo2000/MCU-course/blob/main/images/Example_PWM_LED.jpg?raw=true)

* Edit the following code, and Verify it on NodeMCU-32S with a LED

```
#define LED_GPIO   13
#define PWM1_Ch    0
#define PWM1_Res   8
#define PWM1_Freq  1000
 
int PWM1_DutyCycle = 0;
 
void setup()
{
  ledcAttachPin(LED_GPIO, PWM1_Ch);
  ledcSetup(PWM1_Ch, PWM1_Freq, PWM1_Res);
}
 
void loop()
{
  while(PWM1_DutyCycle < 255)
  {
    ledcWrite(PWM1_Ch, PWM1_DutyCycle++);
    delay(10);
  }
  while(PWM1_DutyCycle > 0)
  {
    ledcWrite(PWM1_Ch, PWM1_DutyCycle--);
    delay(10);
  }
}
```
